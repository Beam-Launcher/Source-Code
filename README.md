Hello everyone!

I have made a custom Beamng.drive launcher. It has extra functionality with updates every so often to make it support the latest version, or to improve how it looks/performs. 
I will also release QoL/Hotfix Updates by adding one digit to the end (x.x.num+1)

This mod will Include multiple Modules (or Mods for short)
These Mods will allow you to perform tasks that would usually take a while longer, with ease. 
One of these Mods is the screenshot tool, allowing you to see your recent screenshots, and open the folder without opening file exporer. 
Another one is the Config installer, allowing you to install custom .pc files to the game easily

This is not affliciate with Beamng, Beamng.drive or Beamng GmbH
